1). Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.

2). Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.

3). Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.



📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on transforming raw operational data into business-ready analytical datasets that support reporting and decision-making.
Key Components:

Data Architecture
Designed a modern data warehouse using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers).

ETL Pipelines
Built SQL-based ETL workflows to extract data from source systems, apply transformations, and load it into the warehouse.

Data Modeling
Developed fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical and reporting use cases.

Analytics & Reporting
Created SQL queries and analytical views to generate meaningful business insights.

🎯 Who This Project Is For
